# RAG_withKnowledgeGRAPH
This repository contains notebooks for building knowledge graphs and using them to improve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
Building a Knowledge Graph from 'SEC Filings': These notebooks guide you through constructing a knowledge graph using Neo4j to represent data extracted from SEC filings.
Integrating Knowledge Graphs into RAG Systems: These notebooks demonstrate how to integrate the constructed knowledge graph into a Retrieval Augmented Generation system using Langchain to retrieve relevant text passages for the language model.
